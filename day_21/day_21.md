1. What is the primary function of the Solana program described in the lesson?

The Solana program demonstrates how to read an account balance in solana without initializing the account's data, similar to how in the EVM we can read an account's balance without necessarily knowing what the contract does.

- How does it utilize the `Context<ReadBalance>` parameter?

The `Context<ReadBalance>` describes for the `read_balance` function what accounts and structs that the function is interacting with. In this case, the context describes the `ReadBalance<'info>` struct which contains the `UncheckedAccount` logic.

2. Explain the role of `UncheckedAccount` in the context of this Solana program.

The `UncheckedAccount` tells the anchor program to not check if the account is owned by the solana program being executed.

- Why is it important to use `UncheckedAccount` for reading the balance of an arbitrary account?

When Anchor reads an account of type `Account` in `#[derive(Accounts)]`, it will check if that account is owned by the program, and halt the execution if the program does not own the account as a safety check.

3. Discuss the potential risks associated with using `UncheckedAccount` as mentioned in the lesson.

Because the Solana program blindly trusts the address supplied, a malicious user could supply an artificial address to break or take advantage of the internal program's logic.

The anchor framework by default blocks this type of attack by checking that the account is indeed owned by the program, and if not rejects reading the account.

`UncheckedAccount` disables this framework level check.

- What are some scenarios where using `UncheckedAccount` could lead to critical errors?

See above.

4. What does the `/// CHECK:` comment signify in the Anchor framework?

The `/// CHECK:` comment is required to use the `UncheckedAccount` modifier to encourage you to not forget about the security considerations when using an `UncheckedAccount`.

- What happens if you remove the `/// CHECK:` comment and run anchor build?

The program will not build in anchor without it.

5. Why does the Solana program not use an `#[account]` struct in this example?

Because the Solana program doesn't actually need to deserialize the data of the account to see what the account's balance is, we don't need to use the `#[account]` macro.

- How does this relate to the program's specific functionality of reading an account's balance?

Similar to the EVM, we can read any account's balance of lamports without needing to know specifics about what the EOA or contract does.

6. According to the lesson, not all SOL in an account is spendable. Explain why this is the case.

Because Solana requires accounts to store `rent` in SOL for the program to not be deleted, the entire balance of the account is not the total amount of spendable SOL.

- How does this information affect applications that handle staking or banking functionalities in Solana?

For apps that rely on checking a user's balance, you should NOT blindly use another account's balance in any check-effect patterns for DeFi use cases.

7. How does the `web3.js` code snippet contribute to the functionality of the Solana program?

The `web3.js` code demonstrates how to access an account's lamport balance (in this case our wallet from `solana address`), and shows how to call the `read_balance` function from the program.

- What role does the `pubkey` variable play in the JavaScript test?

The `pubkey` variable shows how to access the Anchor frameworks `web3.publicKey` method to store the public key as an input for our test.
