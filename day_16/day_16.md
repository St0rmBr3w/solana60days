#### In Ethereum, how are storage variables and bytecode of a smart contract stored, and how does this differ from Solana's approach?

In Ethereum, storage slots are effectively a massive key-value store:

```
{
    key: [smart_contract_address, storage slot]
    value: 32_byte_slot // (for example: 0x00)
}
```

Solana's model is similar: it is a massive key-value store where the "key" is a `base58` encoded address and the value is a data blob that can be up to 10MB large. (this is why in the `day_16.ts` we convert `myStorage.toBase58()`).

In Ethereum, the bytecode of a smart contract and the storage variables of a smart contract are stored separately i.e., they are indexed differently and must be loaded using different APIs. That said, the storage variables are directly coupled to the smart contract.

In Solana, everything is an account that can potentially hold data. Some accounts are labeled `programs`, while others are labeled `storage`, but the only difference is whether there is an `executable` flag.

In Solana, all storage variables can be read by any program, but only its owner program can write to it. The way storage is "tied to" a program is via the owner field.

#### How does Solana's approach to account initialization differ from Ethereum's, particularly regarding the necessity of an explicit initialization transaction? What is the significance of the "init" attribute in the `my_storage` field of the `Initialize` struct in the Solana code snippet provided?

In Ethereum, we can write to a storage variable that we haven't used before.

In Solana, programs need to be explicitly initialized to write to a storage variable (i.e., we need to create the storage account before we write to it).

The init keyword requires:

 - `payer`: which signer is paying the SOL for allocating storage. 

 - `space`: the amount of space the account will take. `std::mem::size_of` will calculate this for us. The `+ 8` is for the discriminator. 

 - `seeds` and `bump`: since a program can own multiple accounts, we need a way to select the correct accounts to work with. The `discriminator` takes up 8 bytes of storage.

#### What is the system program?

The `system program` is similar to an EVM precompile in that it is a program built into the Solana runtime that transfers SOL from one account to another. The `system program` is always a part of initialization transactions.

#### Why is it important to specify the accounts a Solana transaction will interact with in advance, and how is this done in the provided TypeScript code?

Since Solana is parallelized, the Solana runtime needs to be aware of all accounts that the program will be interacting with in a transaction, so that when executing transactions, multiple transactions don't overwrite the same state at once.

We can generate the account we will be working with and pass it to the `intialize` function using Anchor:

```typescript
seeds = []
const [myStorage, _bump] = anchor.web3.PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(seeds, program.programId);
```

#### What is the similarity between predicting the address of initialized accounts in Solana and using the `create2` function in Ethereum, and what are the key components involved in predicting the Solana account address?

In Etheruem, the address of a contract created using `create2` is dependent on the address of the deploying contract, a salt, and the bytecode of the created contract.

In Solana, the process depends on the program that owns the storage account, `basic_storage`, and the `seeds`.

#### Why is it essential that accounts cannot be initialized twice in Solana, and how does Anchor handle this issue?

If we could reinitialize an account, that would be highly problematic since a user could wipe data from the system!
